### Chapter 1
One sequence of bytes can be interpreted in multiple ways.

> **Type** is a classification of data, that define:
> 1) meaning of the data
> 2) set allowed values
> 3) set operations that can be done on the data

>**Type system** is a set of rules that assign types to elements of a programming language (to function, variables etc.) through explicit notation or context-based deduction and allows or disallows type conversions

The remarkable Curry-Howard correspondence shows the connection between login and type theory. We can view type as a logic preposition and a function as a logic implication.

The main benefits of typing are: correctness, immutability, encapsulation, composability, readability.

##### Correctness
Types help to transform run-time issue to compile-time issue.

>A **State space** of a running program is a combination of all possible values of all its live variables, or the cross product of the type of each variable.

##### Security
Many attacks rely on executing user-provided data, buffer overruns etc., types can reduce the possibility of such attacks.

##### Immutability
